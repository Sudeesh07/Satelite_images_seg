# Image Segmentation Project

## Overview
This project focuses on image segmentation using Python. It processes and analyzes image data to identify and segment regions of interest. The notebook leverages popular data science libraries to facilitate image processing and segmentation tasks.

## Features
- Data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
- Image segmentation techniques
- Analysis and visualization of segmented results

## Model Overview
The project implements a deep learning model for image segmentation using **TensorFlow/Keras**. Key components of the model include:
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses `Conv2D`, `BatchNormalization`, and `Activation` layers.
- **Downsampling**: Implemented via `MaxPool2D`.
- **Upsampling and Skip Connections**: Utilizes `Conv2DTranspose` and `Concatenate`, resembling the U-Net architecture.

This structure helps in capturing both spatial and contextual information, improving segmentation accuracy.

## Patchify and Its Impact
The `patchify` function is used to break large images into smaller patches before processing. The image is split into **(256, 256, 3)** patches with a step size of 256, ensuring non-overlapping regions.

### Why Use Patchify?
1. **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces computational load by processing smaller patches instead of entire images.
2. **Better Training Performance**: Helps the model focus on local features.
3. **Avoiding Distortions**: Maintains original resolution without resizing artifacts.

### Impact on Segmentation
- The model predicts segmentation masks for individual patches.
- These predicted patches are **reassembled** to reconstruct the final segmented image.
- If overlapping patches are used (step < patch size), they help smooth out segmentation boundaries.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib tensorflow keras patchify
```
